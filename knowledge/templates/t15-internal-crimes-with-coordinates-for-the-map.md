# T15 — (internal) crimes with coordinates for the map

A whitelisted, parameterised query over the FIR registry. Antar never executes free-form SQL: an officer's question is resolved to one of these templates, or it is refused.

## Questions this answers

* (internal)

## Computation

`app/services/zcql_repo.py::TEMPLATES['T15']` builds a `QuerySpec` from the validated `MapCrimes` parameter model. The spec is compiled to parameterised SQL — every value is bound, never interpolated.

## Attestation

The receipt fields below are what a run must return for its result to be checkable: the template that answered, the bound parameters, and the row ids behind the number. `app/agents/agentic_spine.py::verify_claims` is the deterministic attester — it re-checks every figure in an answer against those rows, with no model in the loop.

*Internal template: used by analytics and scans, hidden from the selector.*
